      The US government seized a plane used by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the US Justice Department said Monday, citing sanctions violations.

      The plane was seized in the Dominican Republic and flown to the southern US state of Florida.
      
      "The Justice Department seized an aircraft we allege was illegally purchased for $13 million through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States for use by Nicolas Maduro and his cronies," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
